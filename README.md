# Books List

A react + vite app for books.



The api part of the code failed after I couldn't use the test api properly.

But I used MUI and antd beautifully

If you want to try the code use these commands by your terminal.

- # Download it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdurahmon27/books-list-react-js.git
```

- # Install packages and depencies

```bash
npm install
```
- # And run the code

```bash
npm run dev
```
